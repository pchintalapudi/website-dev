    After finishing my senior year of undergrad a semester early, I returned to JuliaLab
    for my masters thesis on reducing Julia's compilation latency. In this project, I
    intend to leverage several new capabilities exposed by LLVM's ORC JIT toolchain
    for lazier and parallel compilation to reduce the real time spent in the compiler.
    Currently, my efforts are focusing on removing a global lock that surrounds compilation
    and improving the LLVM-based memory management subsystem to support multithreaded
    compilation. Additionally, I am in charge of migrating Julia from LLVM's old pass
    manager to LLVM's new pass manager, which promises more aggressive analysis caching
    to further reduce time spent in compilation.

    I returned to NVIDIA for a second internship with the PerfSim team, where
    I developed a new feature to track aggregated latency statistics on instructions
    as they flowed through a simulated GPU. By modifying the core infrastructure
    in small ways, I was able to provide support for tracking latency across a
    multitude of different GPU subunits without any extra development effort
    by the teams in charge of those subunits. Once a minimum viable product was
    created, I incorporated feedback from potential customers in the form of
    increased memory and cpu performance as well as a feature to log the paths
    of high latency instructions to enable thorough latency debugging across units.

    At Tornado, I worked on optimizing a machine learning model that was erroring
    due to lack of memory. To reduce memory usage, I leveraged more specific numpy
    and pandas matrix operations, which preallocated matrix space instead of growing
    sequentially. Doing so cut memory usage by more than 50% and saved significant
    CPU time. Additionally, I moved much of the processing from Python into the SQL
    query itself, which allowed the database processor to more efficiently retrieve
    records and further reduced memory consumption of python objects. I then added
    a number of new inputs to the model to improve its prediction capabilities using
    information available in the central database.

    Building off my past experiences in [performance engineering](#6.172) and
    outlining a [virtual machine](#vm), I worked in MIT's JuliaLab to improve
    the Julia compiler. Over the course of two semesters I extended some of the
    Julia-specific passes in the runtime's compiler's LLVM optimization pipeline
    to minimize allocations. Specifically, I implemented multiple optimizations,
    including adjusting the code generator to avoid emitting useless
    instructions, hoisting allocations and write barriers out of loops, and
    teaching the compiler to hoist allocations out of specific branch idioms.
    These improvements have made it onto Julia's master branch and are scheduled
    to be available to users once Julia 1.8 is released.

    For the summer after my junior year, I interned at [NVIDIA](nvidia.com), the
    company that invented the GPU. As part of my assignment, I designed,
    specified, built, and tested a replayer for GPU packets in C++. By
    leveraging the power of C++ templates and automated type inference, I was
    able to provide a low-cost extensible method of autogenerating serialization
    methods without needing to explicitly specify the type of object that was
    being serialized. Additionally, I carefully designed the program to be
    robust and save enough data to replicate segmentation faults and other
    signal-based program crashes while also incrementally compressing the saved
    data on the fly to reduce memory and disk usage. I further developed several
    tools to aggregate statistics about the flow of packets into and out of GPU
    units. In the process of developing the system, I also honed my skills with
    using ssh, tmux, and Perforce as a version control system.

    At [doc.ai](doc.ai), I got my first taste of practical machine learning in a
    startup environment. Working with another intern from MIT, I developed a
    program that could parse clinical protocol PDFs using
    [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) into a document
    tree and then use [spacy.io](https://spacy.io)'s natural language
    functionality to classify the nodes of the document tree as different
    sections of the protocol. In terms of non-code experiences, I learned to
    effectively use git branches and merging, to use HomeBrew on macOS as a
    package manager, and the importance of maintaining open and responsive
    communication channels with other teams dependent on our code.

    At
    [McAfee](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/cloud-security.html),
    I worked with a team on implementing security controls for [Connected
    Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uazaXeCpEA4), 3rd party apps that can
    be installed into platforms such as G Suite and Office 365. Within the team,
    I worked on multiple projects, including securing endpoints with Spring
    Security, creating an automation test suite to verify page loads and
    estimate page load times, and adding new functionality to the application by
    creating new endpoints to support data aggregation into a chart view.
    Besides the actual code though, I also learned many other aspects of robust
    production-level programming, such as Jira issue tracking, the SVN version
    control system, automation testing using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/),
    the Maven build system, and Jenkins continuous integration.

    helping students understand and complete the problems on their assignments
    as well as assessing students on their solutions to the assignments in the

    to other people, this job helped me develop skills in analyzing other
    people's code to quickly locate bugs and performance hotspots, and exposed
    me to many different styles of code and approaches to solving problems.

    their growth patterns in preparation for [co-culturing
    experiments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/coculture)
    with different types of bacteria. The cells were grown in PDMS microwells
    using supplemented keratinocyte cell media, and were stained with DAPI and
    phalloidin to both assess confluence and to validate staining on
    [PDMS](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/molecule-of-the-week/archive/p/polydimethylsiloxane.html)
    microwells. This project gave me experience in working with a laser cutter,
    fabricating and baking PDMS microwell chips for experiments, and process
    characterization.

    focused on mesenchymal stem cells, and characterizing their potential

    variety of environments, transfect and clone plasmids into mammalian and
    bacterial cells, and harvest DNA from bacteria for sequencing. From an
    assaying perspective, I learned the basics of flow cytometry and colony
    counting to assess antibacterial activity.
